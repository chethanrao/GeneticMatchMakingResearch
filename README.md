# GeneticMatchMakingResearch
Research on genetic match making
"Even though many are skeptical of genetic matchmaking, there is profound
evidence showing that genetic compatibility is actually not as “ridiculous” as it sounds."

Further potential use cases:
1) hiring an employee for a team
2) hiring a manager for a team or hiring a manager for set of managers
3) choosing a business partner
4) if genetic match fails for a new hire the person would be matched against several other teams and paired with team that has best genetic match.
skill match + genetic match = magic

Constraints:
Need to be EEOC compliant when considering hiring
